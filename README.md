# Convex

A collection of scripts I created (or copied) to teach myself about the use of convex optimization in IO. 

## [Li (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04444)

The script reproduces the examples in Li's paper.  
I did not attempt the comparison between convex optimization and alternatives.  
I find the performance of convex optimization to be particularly impressive for the pure characteristics model.

The script is just a port of the code gently made available by Jesper Sorensen [here](https://sites.google.com/site/jesperrvs/research?authuser=0).
